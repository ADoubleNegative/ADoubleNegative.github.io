		<h1>BLM Movement</h1>

		<p>Our nation is in a state of civil unrest that needs to be addressed. With these posts, I hope that I can educate you and help guide your view.<br><br>

These protests were SPARKED by the murder of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer while 3 others stood and did nothing. Police are taught that when restraining a person, pressure should be applied to the lower legs, back and shoulders only. The hold used by the officer is not taught at any police academy because it can impact the suspect's carotid artery (the vessel that delivers blood to the brain). Furthermore, that specific hold is considered illegal in professional fighting as they know it can kill your opponent. This shows the blatant disregard for human life these officers subscribe to. 8 minutes of kneeling on one's neck with them moaning in agony to stop is not what a moral person should do or accept. These officers did this because George Floyd was black, there is no excuse or other reason. They could have used the techniques they were taught that ensured the suspect stayed in place without killing them. Floyd didn’t even resist arrest so there is no justification of the use of force displayed by officers.<br><br>


Information on Floyd has told us that he has a history of violence, been imprisoned, and was high at the time of arrest. While these facts are disturbing, it in no way condones the treatment he faced at the hands of police officers and should never discredit the movement many are partaking in. Many are so quick to criticize something when negative information arises, but one bad thing does not define the movement as a whole. You wouldn’t call a bodybuilder unhealthy after they've had a cheat day, so why turn from the Black Lives Matter movement after unsettling, yet unrelated information?  The cries of the Black community are heart-wrenching and a call for action. Everyone else should be using their voice to amplify Black Lives Matter, not trying to tear it down. What does that say about you if you bring down a movement that demands justice from a system that was created to oppress Black people?<br><br>

	    	<p>The protests are not all about George Floyd, but what it says about the treatment of black people at the hands of the police. Breonna Taylor was caught in the crossfires of a shooting that occurred in her home that did not involve her. Emerald Black had a miscarrage due to the excessive use of force by police over bad car registration tags. Rayshard Brooks was shot after he took a taser from an officer that was trying to arrest him. These officers are not doing their job which is to protect the people. Human life is so important and it shouldn't be taken away when an officer feels threatened. Underneath the blue uniforms, police officers are citizens and must abide under the law. They must hold themselves to the same standard they hold citizens. Police officers should not believe they are above the law and can take away someone's life, just because they can get immunity in certain situations. Police officers know that there is danger in the world and yet they took the job willingly. But these Black lives they encounter are not given a say in their treatment because the police system, from its creation, has been conditioned to see Blacks as a greater threat than other races. Of course Blacks are going to flee from the police when confronted. Officers need to be taught on corruption in their own system and what they can do to stop it. Offering classes on psychology, especially focused on the minds of persecuted minorities, can help officers on their decision making during tight encounters. An officer's focus should be on protecting the lives of people, no matter the magnitude of the threat. In a lot of police encounters with Blacks, the former has the upper hand.  Violence and a gun does not have to be the first thing officers turn to. It is evident that police choose to be violent as they are racially biased upon whom they prosecute.<br><br>


This is proved when Dylann Roof was brought to a Burger King after his arrest-he shot up a local church-, but Rayshard Brooks was murdered instead of escorted home. This is proved when the police stood and did nothing while White people protested stay at home orders with guns in hand, yet Black Lives Matter protestors across America were met with teargas and rubber bullets. This is proved when White people get off with a warning but Blacks are met with excessive force. This is proved when police try to search Black people's vehicle and person without a warrant to meet monthly numbers, but don’t do the same to Whites . The Black community is being killed and targeted by the police and it must be stopped. You can help stop it. Donate, sign petitions, go to protests and educate yourselves. The nation is finally accepting that change needs to happen now and with this many people involved and passionate, change is possible.<br><br>


I plan to have more posts talking about the Black Lives Matter movement. I will be taking parts of this article and expanding on them a little as well as other aspects of the movement. I know that many wanted me to have straight facts and I tried, but that's not who I am and it would be defeating the purpose of this blog. I want my voice and opinion to be heard somewhere that I felt comfortable. I feel I have to include some emotion and insight to convince people to side with me and care about these causes. I will be creating a section for purely fact based articles for those who appreciate that but I will also have a section where my input is strong. Sorry this article is so long. I feel that I’ve been silent for so long and I’ve been holding all of this in. My future posts will be shorter and easier to understand as I know this is a lot to swallow. Please contact me at adoublenegative2300@gmail.com with any questions, comments or suggestions, I really appreciate it.
