		<p>I'm sure most of you know the state of civil unrest our nation is in right now. My hopes are to clarify some things for you, such as the reasons behind protests, looting and some phrases that people say.

These protests were SPARKED by the murder of George Floyd at the hands of a police office while 3 others stood and did nothing. The hold used is not taught to cops as a restraining device as they know it can be lethal. Furthermore, that specific hold is considered illegal in (UFC or MMA) fighting as they know it can kill. Now, the protests are not all about George Floyd, but what it says about the treatment of black people at the hands of the police. Information on Floyd has told us that he has a history of violence, been imprisoned, and was high at the time of arrest. While these facts are disturbing, it in no way condones the treatment he faced at the hands of police officers and does not discredit the movement many are partaking in. These protests are not all about one man. This murder was filmed and it got the necessary attention so justice could be served. But there are so many murders and assaults that have no witnesses and when its a black persons word against a white ones, the black voice is drowned out.  

So many stories are told about the looting occurring as a result of protests and because the truth may be different in different areas, I feel like I should talk about the multiple sides. Many claim that the ones who started looting and riots seemed organized, as a part of a group. Some reported seeing them having walkie talkies or being undercover cops trying to discredit the movement. Others might have been actual protesters who felt something drastic needed to happen in order to have their voices heard. Peaceful protests have been going on for so long with minimal reform



They continue to go on because black people and their allies have seen continuous injustice without reform. Additionally,</p>
