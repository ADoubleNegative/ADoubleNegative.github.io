				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p class="text">
             I am creating this blog with the hopes of educating youth on things the media censors or paints as negative. For a little over a month, I have had this idea to create a place where I could educate youth and clarify misconceptions given to us by society. I had been annoyed and angered by the censorship in health classes, false depictions of relationships, mistreatment of minorities, criticisms of females, disregard for human life, and so much more. I felt that posting on my instagram story wouldn't do anything because most of my followers had the same view as me, it would be preaching to the choir. But I saw the way one of my younger friends reacted when I talked about something serious, she brushed it off or made a joke out of it. These moments made me realize that the youth need to be educated so they can help us drive a change. If they are to first hear about societal issues in their teens, the generation after them will still go through those issues because they think they are not old enough to understand. In order to have change we should start from the roots, teach kids at a young age how to combat the negative ideals forced upon them by society so that one day those ideals are lessened. Kids are especially susceptible to falsities presented to them on television and through parents. I want to help kids develop their own view using my feelings based on facts. While my goal is to educate younger youth, I do plan to have some mature and advanced articles for high-school aged and beyond users. I believe that being a knowledgeable citizen is valuable and important in figuring out what YOU stand for, not what the media tells you to. Biased media takes away some of the facts, humanity, pain, and unity that those in power see as a threat, but it should be known by all. Education is so important not just for youth, but for adults that threaten the well being of the people. Please help me in my goal and share this with as many people as you can, especially youth.

					
This blog is called A Double Negative because Iâ€™m taking two negatives to create a positive. The first negative comes from the topics the media paints as negative. The second negative comes from me being part of the left wing since left of the origin on a coordinate plane is negative. Put these together and you get my articles, which I hope create positive responses and attitudes towards the issues I discuss.
