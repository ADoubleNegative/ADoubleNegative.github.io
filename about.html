				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p class="text">
                The blog I am creating will be used to draw positive attention and attitudes to issues the media paints as negative. This will mostly be targeted towards middle schoolers as I feel like they are affected intensely by biased media. For some of these kids, televised media is the only source of information they get and they may not know how biased it is . Pair that with some of the more conservative views of parents and little communication about societal issues at home, and kids are subliminally programed to believe inequality, discrimination, and absolute censorship are accapable. I believe that being a knowledgeable citizen is valuable and important in figuring out what YOU stand for, not what the media tells you to. Biased media takes away the facts, humanity, pain, and unity that those in power see as a threat, but it should be known by all. I hope that bringing light to these issues and removing the stigma that surrounds them can help young teens learn the facts and, without sway one way another, form their own opinions.
